# Pay4Later-Coding-Challenge
This is a solution to a coding exercise which I had to complete as part of the application process, for a Junior Software Development position.

## The Task 

### https://github.com/pay4later/php-task

* Parse a collection of XML, CSV and JSON files from a provided data-set
* Order the rows by the userId in ascending order
* Write the ordered results to new xml, csv and json files, see the examples directory
  * Results should use the same structure as the source files they were parsed from
  * The exception is for lastLoginTime where an ISO 8601 date format is preferred for output
